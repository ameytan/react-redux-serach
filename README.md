# Ascora Interview Challenge

## Introduction
First of all, I would like to thank you for taking the time to solve this little task. This allows us to get to know you better and to assess your level.

## Task Description
The challenge for you here is to prepare in React or Angular (your choice) a simple application that should allow the user to see a list of our Abelssoft products and to search for items by the program's name.
We already prepared the server that provides the program's data and the basic structure of the frontend (e.g. API client for Angular).
Your job is it to work on completing the application.

### Task Details
- Implement API calls needed to fetch programs' data
- Fill placeholder fields for e.g. program's description or image with data from API

## Steps For Startup
You need to run the backend code at first. Please go to the `server` folder and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

Run the frontend (`client-angular` or `client-react-ts`):

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```
